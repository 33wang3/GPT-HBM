Does this text explicitly or implicitly discuss the severity of HPV-related health conditions (such as cervical cancer, throat cancer, genital warts, etc.)? Look for language that describes the serious consequences or life-threatening nature of HPV, or mentions long-term health outcomes if untreated. If the text refers to severe outcomes of HPV infection, output the final answer as [[YES]]. If the text does not discuss the seriousness or impact of HPV-related health issues, output the final answer as [[NO]].
